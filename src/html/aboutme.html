            Hello reader, my name is Ja'Quis Franklin. I am a Full Stack Developer
            from and currently located in Charlotte, NC who creates and develops
            web applications. I have experience in several languages such as HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Java. I am a student at the University of
            North Carolina at Charlotte pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer
            Science. I am currently seeking an internship position to further my
            knowledge and gain experience in the field of Computer Science. I fell
            in love with programming at an early age. I was always fascinated with
            how computers worked and how they could be used to solve problems. I
            started learning how to code early in elementary school with blocks (I
            Know LOL) and have been coding ever since. I have always been a
            problem solver and I love to learn new things. I am always looking for
            ways to improve my skills and learn new technologies. I am a dedicated
            learner who is always looking for ways to improve and grow in the
            field of Computer Science and life. I hope to always bring this
            mentality to any team that I am a part of and to any project that I
            work on. If you read all of this thank you for taking the time to
            learn a little bit about me.
